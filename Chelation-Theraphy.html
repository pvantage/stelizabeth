<h1>CHELATION THERAPY</h1>
Chelation (Key-ley-shun) therapy means using medication to remove certain toxic metals (including lead) and other toxic substances from the body. These medications bind to the metals and substances, which have built up in the body over time, and remove them through the urine or stool. Chelation therapy was approved by the FDA for the removal of heavy metals.<br>
<h1>What Is It?</h1>
The main drug of the Chelation Therapy is EDTA. This is a synthetic/modified amino acid. It has an unusual ability to strongly attract/bind to minerals, including toxic metals-lead, aluminum, calcium, and others.<br><br>

<div class="paragraph-details">
Chelation therapy is cost efficient, relatively painless, and is covered by many insurance companies based on blood level and necessity. Chelation may help restore function to the lining of the arteries that carry the oxygen and nutrition throughout our bodies. Chelation is a relatively unknown therapy because the patent on EDTA has expired, this means that any pharmaceutical company can manufacture it removing financial incentive to promote EDTA. The American Heart Association (AHA) claims there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate any benefit from EDTA Chelation Therapy, but there has been over 10,000 scientific papers written which support its use in many different areas.<br><br></div>
<div class="lead-text">
<h1>Lead Exposure and Toxicity</h1>
Lead is a highly toxic metallic chemical that has no known benefits in the human body. Lead exists naturally as an element in the earth. Air, food, water, soil, and dust all may contain lead.Your body’s level of lead toxicity rises as you absorb lead which can happen when you swallow or breathe in tiny particles of lead dust. Many people attain lead exposure by forgetting to wash their hands before they eat, drink or smoke.</div>
